# Enhanced-emotes

# TODO

- Add gui
- Add more emotes: https://pastebin.com/6mrYTdQv

# KNOWN ISSUE

- If you change file into config.ini & _resource.lua, you'll have to reboot the game to get the new one

# NOTE

- You can pull request your new json files if you want, so they will be shared with the community
